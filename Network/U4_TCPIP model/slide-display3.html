    <h2>Four Layers of TCP/IP Model</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The TCP/IP model is a framework for networking that consists of four distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Interacts with software applications to provide communication functions.</li>
                    <li>Protocols include HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of messages between hosts.</li>
                    <li>Protocols include TCP (for reliable transmission) and UDP (for faster, connectionless transmission).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Internet Layer</strong>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Handles the routing of packets across the network.</li>
                    <li>Responsible for logical addressing (IP addressing).</li>
                    <li>Main protocol is the Internet Protocol (IP).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Link Layer</strong>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Facilitates communication between devices on the same network.</li>
                    <li>Includes protocols for network access, like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.</li>
                    <li>Responsible for framing and MAC addressing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The model allows for interoperability between various network devices and protocols, forming the basis for Internet communication.</li>
    </ul>
