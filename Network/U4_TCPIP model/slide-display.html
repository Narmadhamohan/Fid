        <strong>TCP Model / IP Model</strong>
        <p>
            The TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a conceptual framework used to implement protocols in the internet and other computer networks. It consists of four layers:
            <ul>
                <li>Application Layer: Corresponds to the OSI model's Application, Presentation, and Session layers. It provides services directly to end-user applications, such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.</li>
                <li>Transport Layer: Manages end-to-end communication, error detection, and flow control between hosts. Protocols include TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (unreliable, connectionless).</li>
                <li>Internet Layer: Responsible for routing and addressing packets of data using the IP protocol. It corresponds to the OSI model's Network Layer.</li>
                <li>Link Layer: Ensures that data is transmitted over physical media. It includes protocols that operate on the physical and data link layers of the OSI model.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ARPANet Architecture</strong>
        <p>
            ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first operational packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet. The ARPANET architecture was based on a distributed network model, where each node (router) could independently route packets across the network. The design used protocols like the Network Control Program (NCP), which was later replaced by the more robust TCP/IP protocol suite.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>IP Addresses, Classes, Subnetting</strong>
        <p>
            An IP address is a unique identifier for devices on a network. There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit). IPv4 addresses are divided into classes based on the first few bits:
            <ul>
                <li>Class A: Supports large networks with many devices (1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0).</li>
                <li>Class B: Used for medium-sized networks (128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255).</li>
                <li>Class C: For small networks (192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255).</li>
                <li>Class D: Reserved for multicast (224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255).</li>
                <li>Class E: Reserved for experimental use (240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255).</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Subnetting</strong> involves dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks. It is done by manipulating the subnet mask, which defines the network and host portions of an IP address, helping optimize network performance and security.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Protocols (IP, HTTP, TCP, FTP, ARP)</strong>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP (Internet Protocol):</strong> Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data across the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):</strong> A protocol used for transmitting web pages over the internet. It operates at the application layer.</li>
                <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):</strong> A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission between two devices.</li>
                <li><strong>FTP (File Transfer Protocol):</strong> A protocol for transferring files between systems. It provides a simple way to access and manage files on a remote server.</li>
                <li><strong>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):</strong> A protocol used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address in a local area network.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Importance on Ports</strong>
        <p>
            Ports are communication endpoints in a network. They allow multiple services to operate on a single IP address by identifying specific processes. Ports are identified by numbers, with common ones including:
            <ul>
                <li>Port 80: HTTP (web traffic).</li>
                <li>Port 443: HTTPS (secure web traffic).</li>
                <li>Port 21: FTP (file transfers).</li>
                <li>Port 25: SMTP (email transmission).</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Common Ports:</strong> Standardized port numbers allow users and devices to interact with known services. They help in identifying the intended application on a network server.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>TCP & UDP Ports Difference</strong>
        <p>
            The main difference between TCP and UDP ports lies in how the protocols operate:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Ports:</strong> TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission by establishing a connection, checking for errors, and ensuring data is received in the correct order. Common TCP ports include 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 25 (SMTP).</li>
                <li><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol) Ports:</strong> UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows data to be sent without establishing a connection or ensuring reliability. It's faster but less reliable than TCP. Common UDP ports include 53 (DNS), 69 (TFTP), and 161 (SNMP).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
