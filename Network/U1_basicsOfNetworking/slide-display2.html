    <h1>Types of Networks</h1>

    <div class="section lan">
        <h2>Local Area Network (LAN)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers within a limited area, such as a home, school, or office.</li>
            <li>Typically spans a few hundred meters.</li>
            <li>High data transfer rates, generally ranging from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps.</li>
            <li>Commonly used technologies: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section man">
        <h2>Metro Area Network (MAN)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Metro Area Network (MAN) connects multiple LANs within a specific geographic area, such as a city.</li>
            <li>Typically spans up to 50 kilometers.</li>
            <li>Used to connect various LANs in a metropolitan area.</li>
            <li>Common applications include connecting government offices and educational institutions.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section wan">
        <h2>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a large geographic area, connecting multiple LANs and MANs.</li>
            <li>Can span cities, countries, or even continents.</li>
            <li>Typical data transfer rates are much lower compared to LANs, often ranging from 56 Kbps to 1 Gbps.</li>
            <li>Examples include the Internet and private corporate networks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section pan">
        <h2>Personal Area Network (PAN)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A Personal Area Network (PAN) is a small network, typically within a range of a few meters.</li>
            <li>Used for connecting devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.</li>
            <li>Common technologies include Bluetooth and infrared.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section http">
        <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents on the web.</li>
            <li>It facilitates communication between clients and servers.</li>
            <li>HTTP works by establishing a connection between a web browser (client) and a web server.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section client-server">
        <h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The client-server model is a distributed application structure that separates tasks between service providers (servers) and service requesters (clients).</li>
            <li>Clients request resources or services from the server, which processes the requests and sends back the appropriate response.</li>
            <li>This architecture is fundamental to web applications, where web browsers act as clients and web servers provide data.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section communication">
        <h2>Communication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication in networking refers to the transfer of data between devices over a network.</li>
            <li>It involves protocols that define how data is transmitted and received.</li>
            <li>Effective communication ensures reliable and efficient data exchange.</li>
        </ul>
