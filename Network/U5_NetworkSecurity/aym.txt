To make it even simpler using three-letter words, let’s modify the example by encoding letters into numbers (A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on) and using a simple encryption process with small public/private keys. Here's the updated scenario:

### Scenario: Alice and Bob want to send the word "CAT" using asymmetric encryption.

#### Step 1: Assign Numbers to Letters
We will convert each letter to a number using this pattern:
- **C = 3**
- **A = 1**
- **T = 20**

So, the message "CAT" becomes the numbers: **3, 1, 20**.

#### Step 2: Generate Keys
- **Alice’s public key**: `7`
- **Alice’s private key**: `3`
- **Bob’s public key**: `11`
- **Bob’s private key**: `5`

#### Step 3: Encrypt the Message ("CAT")
Bob wants to send "CAT" to Alice.

1. **For "C" (3)**:
   - Encrypted letter = `3 × 7 = 21`

2. **For "A" (1)**:
   - Encrypted letter = `1 × 7 = 7`

3. **For "T" (20)**:
   - Encrypted letter = `20 × 7 = 140`

So, the encrypted message that Bob sends to Alice is: **21, 7, 140**.

#### Step 4: Decrypt the Message
Alice receives the encrypted message and uses her private key (`3`) to decrypt it.

1. **For "21"** (which represents "C"):
   - Decrypted letter = `21 ÷ 3 = 7`
   - This corresponds to the letter **C** (3).

2. **For "7"** (which represents "A"):
   - Decrypted letter = `7 ÷ 3 = 1`
   - This corresponds to the letter **A** (1).

3. **For "140"** (which represents "T"):
   - Decrypted letter = `140 ÷ 3 = 20`
   - This corresponds to the letter **T** (20).

So, Alice successfully decrypts the message "CAT."

### Simple Steps for the Students:
1. **Bob encrypts**: Multiply the letter's number by Alice's public key (`7`).
2. **Alice decrypts**: Divide the encrypted number by her private key (`3`).

This example helps the students see how letters can be encoded into numbers, encrypted, and decrypted in a straightforward way using small keys.


**************************************************************


Alice generates her **own private key** when she sets up her asymmetric encryption system. In asymmetric encryption:

1. **Key Pair Generation**: 
   - Alice uses a cryptographic algorithm (such as RSA) to generate **two keys**: 
     - **Public key** (shared with others)
     - **Private key** (kept secret)

2. **Ownership**: 
   - The private key is not given to Alice by anyone else; it is **created** during the key pair generation process.
   - Since Alice is the one generating both keys, she keeps her **private key** secure and never shares it.

### How Key Generation Works:
- **Public-Private Key Pair**: These keys are mathematically linked. Any message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.
- For example, if Alice uses an RSA algorithm, the algorithm will generate two keys at once:
  - Public key (to be shared).
  - Private key (which Alice keeps safe).

This generation process ensures that Alice is the **only** one who ever possesses her private key, making it secure. 

### Summary:
Alice **creates her own private key** during the setup of the encryption system, and no one else is involved in giving her that private key.
