              High Level:
A high-level language is a programming language that is more abstracted from the hardware and closer to human language.
It simplifies programming by providing easier syntax, automatic memory management, and portability across different systems.
Eg:
Java: A high-level, object-oriented language.
Python: Known for its simplicity and readability.

			Middle Level:
A middle-level language bridges the gap between low-level and high-level languages. It allows for direct hardware manipulation while also providing higher-level abstractions for ease of programming
Eg: C: Allows direct memory access via pointers, but also includes high-level features like functions.

               Low Level:
A low-level language is a programming language that is closer to machine code (binary) and is closely tied to a computerâ€™s hardware.

                A block is a group of statements enclosed in braces. It can be used wherever a single statement is allowed.
                <br><br>
                Example:<br>
				<a href="expressions_programs.html">Block sample code</a>
                <code>A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. The following example, BlockDemo, illustrates the use of blocks:</code>

                These statements regulate the execution order of other statements, such as loops and conditionals.

                Example:<br>
                <code>if (condition) {<br>...<br>} else {<br>...<br>}</code>
